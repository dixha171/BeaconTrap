# BeaconTrap Report Generation Engine

Version: 1.0

This document defines how BeaconTrap transforms forensic artifacts into clear, role-specific investigation reports.

---

# Objectives

The Report Engine must:

- Generate explainable reports from structured artifacts
- Support multiple stakeholder personas
- Preserve evidence traceability
- Produce reproducible outputs
- Export reports in multiple formats

The Report Engine performs **presentation only**. It must never introduce new analysis or modify the Risk Engine's conclusions.

This ensures future reproducibility.

---

# Digital Integrity

- Retry rendering
- Notify user
- Log failure

Never lose analysis artifacts because rendering failed.

---

# Testing

Validate

- Template rendering
- Missing fields
- Long reports
- Unicode support
- PDF generation
- HTML rendering

Regression tests should compare generated reports against approved snapshots.

---
